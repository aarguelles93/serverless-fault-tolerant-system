# Serverless Fault-Tolerant Task Processing System

## Overview

This project is a fault-tolerant and event driven backend system built on AWS, designed to reliably process tasks that includes failure handling and retry logic.  
It implements async task submission, processing, retry with exponential backoff, and dead-letter queue monitoring.
